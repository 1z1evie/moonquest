## Description:
 A dead simple percision platformer for the PICO-8 fantasy console. The project is still very much an alpha build and a work in progress, and I will soon implement features such as moving hazards and a victory screen. All code is written for the PICO-8 fantasy console, which uses LUA as its base.
## How to install/play:
Download `moonquest.p8` from the files section. Open the PICO-8 console. In the console type `folder` to open the directory on your desktop. Move the file `moonquest.p8` into the folder. Then in the PICO-8 console type:
```
load moonquest.p8
run moonquest.p8
```
## Guide:
PICO-8 has 6 main inputs, the arrow keys and two other inputs, which are typically bound to 'z' and 'x'. Use the arrow keys to move and press 'x' to jump.
